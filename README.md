# Education equilibria 

An attempt to create an M matrix for county level categorical education data. 
Based on methods used in problem set 7 for soci 756, fall 2021.
 
ps7.Rmd is dependent on "H:/soci756/ps7.csv"

m matrix attempt.Rmd is dependent on "H:/amy/equilibria" 

(CHRR SAS datasets are too large to put on git. Not sure best practice in this case.)
