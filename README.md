# Education equilibria 

An attempt to create an M matrix for county level categorical education data. 
Based on methods used in problem set 7 for soci 756, fall 2021.
 
ps7.Rmd is dependent on "H:/soci756/ps7.csv". It contains code for finding M matrices given population life tables. 

m matrix attempt.Rmd is dependent on "H:/amy/equilibria". It contains the start of some code for attempting to find M matrices given education and migration values at the county level.  

Mare1997.pdf is the paper from which the methods are based. 

NST-EST2021-ALLDATA.pdf is the readme for CHRR migration data (vintage2020.sas7bdat - not included here because too large) 

ps6_Fall2021.pdf is the original hw assignment (this is helpful to understand/interpret ps7.Rmd 

Tables_ProblemSet6_2021.pdf are the data used by ps7.Rmd. This file is helpful to interpret the methods in ps7.Rmd
